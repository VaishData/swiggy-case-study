## 📊 Problem Statement

Using the **Funnel Case Study Data** workbook (3 sheets), we analyzed:

- **Session Details** – Tracking listing → order funnel stages
- **Channel-wise Traffic** – Identifying sources of traffic fluctuations
- **Supporting Metrics** – Contextual features like avg. cost, stock-outs, discounts, etc.

The aim was to:

- Identify **highs and lows in orders** vs. the same day of the previous week
- Detect **traffic shifts** and **channel-specific** influences
- Measure **conversion drops across funnel stages** (L2M, M2C, C2P, P2O)
- Validate **hypotheses** using operational metrics

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **User Behavior**: Mid-week (Tuesdays, Thursdays) showed dips in engagement, while weekends saw natural spikes.
- **Traffic Source**: Facebook was the dominant channel; suggesting the need to diversify acquisition sources.
- **Conversion Trends**: Drop-offs in Menu-to-Cart (M2C) and Cart-to-Payment (C2P) stages affected order completions.
- **External Events**: Festive months like September saw a spike in active restaurants and engagement.
- **Order Loss**: High meal costs, increased delivery charges, and out-of-stock items correlated with cancellations.

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Run **targeted campaigns** mid-week and capitalize on **weekend surges**
- **Diversify traffic sources** beyond Facebook (e.g., Google Ads, influencers)
- Optimize **stock availability**, delivery, and packing fees
- Leverage **festive months** for special promotions and collaborations
- Implement **loyalty programs** to retain high-LTV users
